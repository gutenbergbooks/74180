<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following pages contain a collection of Stories
of the War of 1812, with Great Britain; and of the
Recent War, with the Republic of Mexico.</p>

<p>Rightly considered, the first of these national wars
was a supplement to the glorious War of Independence.
Up to the time when our government boldly threw
down the gauntlet of defiance to the most powerful
nation of Europe, in defence of Free Trade and
Sailor’s Rights, the British nation regarded us as revolted
subjects, successful for the moment, but destined
always to be governed by British influence and
ultimately to be reconquered.</p>

<p>The events of the second war with Great Britain
finished what the first had begun, and set the seal on
our Independence. From the period of its conclusion,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>

our flag was respected by Britain and all other nations.
Our naval prowess was recognized as a fixed
fact.</p>

<p>The recent war with Mexico has taught the world
another lesson. It has shown that with a standing
army of very few men, and a good militia system, the
republic is capable of raising large and efficient
armies, and conquering a military republic, of immense
population, wealth, and resources, possessing a powerful
standing army; accustomed, in consequence of the
distracted state of the country, to frequent action and
constant discipline.</p>

<p>The wars which teach these lessons are worthy the
attention of the youth of our country; and we have
endeavored to render these stories of the wars sufficiently
attractive to win that degree of attention
and interest which will insure a future study of American
history.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">SURRENDER OF DETROIT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> June, 1812, the United States declared
war against Great Britain. The
chief cause of the war was the impressment
of American seamen by the British.
General Hull, with twenty-five hundred
men, took post at Detroit, in Michigan.
Soon afterward, the British general, Brock,
with thirteen hundred men, appeared
before Detroit, erected batteries, and
summoned Hull to surrender. He refused,
and the British opened their fire upon

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>

the works. On the 26th, they crossed
the river and moved forward to the
attack. The American troops were prepared
to receive them, and eager for the
conflict. But as the British approached,
Hull ordered his men to retire into the
fort, and hoisted a white flag. In a short
time, terms of surrender were agreed
upon, and the whole American army,
with all its ammunition and stores were
given up to the British. This surrender
excited the indignation of the people.
Hull was accused of cowardice, tried by
a court martial, and sentenced to be shot.
The President, however, in consideration
of his age and services, remitted the
punishment, but ordered his name to be
stricken from the rolls of the army.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">BATTLE OF QUEENSTOWN.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in October, 1812, about three
thousand five hundred men, under command
of General Van Rensselaer, were
assembled on the Niagara frontier. General
Van Rensselaer resolved to make
an attack on the British position at
Queenstown, eight miles below Niagara
Falls. At daybreak on the 13th of October,
the troops began to embark to
cross the river. The British opened a
fire upon them, which was returned by
the American batteries. Colonel Van
Rensselaer, with about one hundred men,
reached the shore, and stormed the fort

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>

of the British, though not without severe
loss. The Americans drove the enemy
from the field, and the victory was supposed
to be gained, when another reinforcement
arrived, and the conflict was
renewed. At this critical moment, General
Van Rensselaer crossed the river
to bring a reinforcement for his gallant
little band, and found that the militia
would not obey his orders. Colonel
Christie maintained the fight on the opposite
shore, against overwhelming numbers,
until seeing no hope of relief, he
surrendered the remnant of his force.
The Americans lost one thousand men in
all, in this battle. The loss of the enemy
was somewhat less, but their noble commander,
the gallant Brock, was slain.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">DEFENCE OF FORT HARRISON.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fort</span> Harrison was a post on the Wabash
river, in the heart of the Indian
country. It consisted of two blockhouses,
stockade works, and a few buildings for
stores or magazines. In September 1812,
sixteen men, under the command of Captain
Zachary Taylor, formed the garrison
of this post. On the 3d of September,
two men, who were working in the field
near it, were murdered by the Indians,
and on the night of the 4th, the savages
set fire to one of the blockhouses, and
commenced an assault. Captain Taylor,
though suffering from sickness displayed

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>

the greatest coolness and resolution.
Two of his men leaped over the stockade
and fled, and the others were seized with
a panic. But he restored their hopes,
and by tearing off the roof of the barracks,
and other means, succeeded in
quenching the fire. The savages poured
a steady fire into the fort. The invalids
of the garrison returned it, and the conflict
was fierce and desperate until daybreak,
when the enemy retreated beyond
the reach of the fort. They beleaguered
the garrison, however, for twelve days,
when a large body of troops arrived, and
forced them to raise the siege.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the commencement of the war, the
navy of Great Britain was looked upon
as invincible. But an important victory
changed the opinion of the people of the
United States. The frigate Constitution,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>

commanded by Captain Isaac Hull, sailed
from Annapolis on the 25th of July, 1812,
for New York. Falling in with a British
fleet, she only escaped by great skill and
seamanship. Soon after she sailed from
Boston, and on the 19th of August encountered
the British frigate, Guerriere,
commanded by Captain Dacres. A fierce
conflict of about half an hour’s length
ensued. The Guerriere was reduced to
a wreck, and after her surrender, burned.
In this action the Americans had seven
men killed, and seven wounded. The
British loss was fifteen killed, sixty-two
wounded, and twenty-four missing. The
effect of this victory was to give the
Americans confidence in the skill and
bravery of their seamen.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> United States sloop-of-war Wasp,
of eighteen guns, commanded by Captain
Jacob Jones, sailed from the Delaware,
on the 13th of October; and on the 18th
of the month, after a long and heavy
gale, fell in with a convoy of six merchantmen,
four of them strongly armed,
under the protection of His Britannic Majesty
sloop-of-war Frolic, of twenty-two
guns, Captain Whinyates. At half-past
eleven in the morning, the action commenced
at the distance of about fifty
yards. But, during the action, so near
did they come to each other, that the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>

rammers of the Wasp’s cannon struck
against the side of the Frolic. The fire
of the English vessel soon slackened; and
after a most sanguinary action of forty-three
minutes, every brace of the Wasp
being shot away, and the rigging so much
torn, that Captain Jones resolved to board
the enemy. With this view he wore ship
and running down upon the enemy, the
vessels struck. The officers surrendered
the vessel, and the colors were hauled
down by Lieutenant Biddle. The Frolic
was in a shocking condition; the berth-deck
was filled with dead and wounded.
No sooner had the engagement ceased,
than the British ship, Poictiers, of seventy
four guns, came up, and captured both
vessels.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">General Dearborn</span>, the commander of
the United States forces on the Ontario
frontier, having resolved to attack York,
the capital of Upper Canada, embarked
seventeen hundred troops, and left
Sackett’s Harbor on the 25th of April.
On the 27th, the troops, under the command
of General Pike, effected a landing
and drove a much superior force of the
enemy from the shore. But they returned
to the attack, and the contest was renewed.
The enemy were again defeated
and driven to their works. The whole
force of the Americans having reached
the shore, and being arranged in the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>

order for attack, General Pike pressed
forward, carried one of the enemy’s batteries,
and was moving towards the main
works, when a sudden and tremendous
explosion of the magazine occurred,
hurling upon the advancing troops immense
masses of stone and timber, and
for a time checking them by the havoc
it made. General Pike was mortally
wounded. But the troops under command
of Colonel Pearce, pressed on, and
captured the town, with all the land and
naval forces in and about it. The total
loss of the Americans was three hundred
and twenty men. General Pike was
greatly lamented. The British loss was
four hundred killed or wounded, and three
hundred prisoners.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the capture of York, General
Dearborn resolved to attempt the capture
of Fort George. On the morning
of the 27th of May, the light troops under
Colonel Scott and Major Forsyth, supported
by Colonel Porter’s light artillery
and General Lewis’s division, crossed
the Niagara river, and attacked the fort.
Other brigades of troops followed. Commodore
Chauncey had made judicious
arrangements with his small ships, to
silence the enemy’s batteries at the point
of landing. The descent was warmly
contested at the water’s edge, by the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>

British; but they were soon compelled
to give way, and the landing was completed.
The American batteries soon
succeeded in rendering the fort untenable.
The British, retiring from the banks of
the river, re-entered the fort, fired a few
shot, set fire to the magazine, and then
moved off in different directions. Of the
British regular troops, ninety were killed,
one hundred and sixty wounded, and one
hundred captured. The Americans lost
seventeen killed, and sixty wounded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> retaliate for the capture of York,
Sir George Prevost, the British general-in-chief,
determined to make a descent
on Sackett’s Harbor, the chief American
depot for stores, on the lakes. Accordingly,
on the 27th of May, 1813, Prevost,
with nearly a thousand men, embarked
in small boats, and proceeded, under
convoy of the British fleet. The fleet
being seen on the lake, preparations were
made for the defence of the post. General
Brown, with six hundred militia,
came to the aid of the few regular troops,
and made wise disposition for the reception

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>

of the enemy. Prevost arrived, and
commenced the attack on the evening of
the 28th. The first line of the militia
fired, and then gave way. But Brown,
with the rest of his troops, maintained
his ground against the assault, and
poured such a well aimed fire into the
enemy, that they were checked. The
success was followed up, and at length,
the British were driven to their boats.
Through some mistake the American
stores were burned by the officer set to
guard them. This victory brought the
military talents of General Brown to
light.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> defence of Fort Stephenson, at
Lower Sandusky, was one of the most
brilliant exploits in the annals of war.
It was an unfinished stockade fort, garrisoned
by one hundred and fifty men,
under the command of Major George
Croghan. General Harrison had sent
word to the major, that he should abandon
the fort on the approach of the
enemy. But he did not think a retreat
possible, and, moreover, was determined
to perish, rather than surrender. On
the 28th of May, Proctor, with twenty-two
hundred British and Indians, appeared

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>

before the fort, and summoned
the garrison to surrender. Receiving the
most heroic refusal, he opened a heavy
fire, which was continued during the
night and all next day, when the enemy
advanced to the assault. Croghan had
but one six-pounder in the fort. This
was masked, and other preparations made
to receive the foe. The assault was furious,
but the fire of the heroic garrison
committed such havoc that the British
were compelled to fall back in confusion,
and soon after they abandoned the siege,
having lost over two hundred men. Croghan’s
loss was trifling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in the spring of 1813, the attention
of the government of the United
States, was directed to the important

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>

object of obtaining the command of Lake
Erie. The earnest representations of
General Harrison had awakened the administration
to a proper sense of the necessity
of this measure. The British already
had an efficient naval force upon
the lake, and it gave them great advantages.
Two brigs and several schooners
were ordered to be built, under the direction
of Captain Oliver H. Perry. That
able and active officer saw that the work
was carried on with the greatest rapidity,
and on the 2d of August, he was able to
sail in quest of the enemy’s squadron.
The British, though much superior in
force, did not venture out to meet the
new squadron.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of the 10th of September,
while Perry’s squadron was lying in
Put-in-bay, in Bass Island, the enemy’s
fleet was discovered standing out from
the port of Malden, with the wind in
their favor. The American fleet immediately
weighed anchor, cleared the islands
at the head of the lake, and was formed
in line of battle. A little before twelve
o’clock, the action commenced, the British
having the weathergage. For some
time, the fire of the enemy was concentrated
upon the St. Lawrence, Perry’s
flag-ship, and she was much cut up,
most of her crew killed or wounded, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>

her guns disabled. In the midst of the
lire, Captain Perry passed in an open
boat from the Lawrence to the Niagara,
and succeeded in bringing the rest of his
fleet into action. A well directed fire
was then opened upon the enemy, and
the battle then became close and warm.
At length the British vessels having suffered
severely from the superior gunnery
of the Americans, struck their colors.
The Lawrence, whose flag had been hauled
down soon after Perry had left her, had
been enabled to hoist it before the end

to take possession of her. The American
loss was twenty-five killed, and ninety-six
wounded; that of the enemy, forty-one
killed, and ninety-five wounded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as General Harrison received
the news of the triumph on Lake Erie,
he hastened to put his army in motion
to meet Proctor. Crossing the Lake, by
means of Perry’s victorious squadron, he
reached Malden, which the British and
Indians had abandoned the day before.
On the 2d of October, Harrison moved
forward in pursuit of the enemy, and on
the 5th, came up with them, at a strong
position on the banks of the Thames.
The Indians, under Tecumseh, were
placed in a dense wood, while the British
regulars were drawn up in open files,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>

their flanks protected by the river and a
morass. Colonel Johnson, with the
mounted volunteers, was ordered to attack
the Indians, while Harrison formed
another battalion of the same troops, and
ordered them to charge and break the
line of regulars. This novel manœuvre
was executed with complete success.
The British force was compelled to surrender.
The Indians maintained a desperate
contest until the great Tecumseh
was slain, when they broke and fled.
This victory was decisive. Very few
were killed and wounded on both sides,
but the enemy were entirely captured
or dispersed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 5th of September, 1813, the
United States brig Enterprize, of fourteen
guns, commanded by Lieutenant Burrows,
sailed from Portsmouth, and the
next day fell in with the British brig,
Boxer, of fourteen guns, commanded by
Captain Blythe. The latter immediately
fired a shot as a challenge, hoisted English
colors, and bore down on the Enterprize.
The American vessel manœuvered
until she gained the weathergage,
and then returned the fire. Obtaining
a raking position, the Enterprize soon
gained the advantage, and after an action

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>

of three quarters of an hour, compelled
the British to cry for quarter. Their
colors were nailed to the mast, but the
firing ceased. Captain Blythe and Lieutenant
Burrows were mortally wounded
in the early part of the action. Burrows
refused to be carried below until
the sword of the enemy was presented
to him, when he exclaimed, “I am now
satisfied—I die contented.” The Boxer
had twenty-five men killed, and fourteen
wounded. The Enterprize had four men
killed, and eleven wounded.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">BATTLE OF LUNDY’S LANE.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> battle of Lundy’s Lane was the
best contested action of the war of 1812.
On the afternoon of the 24th of July,
1814, General Brown received a notice
that the British general had thrown a
thousand men across the lake to Lewistown,
nine miles below Chippewa. To
divert them from what he supposed to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span>

be their object, the American general ordered
General Winfield Scott, with his
brigade of thirteen hundred men, to advance
and threaten the forts at the
mouth of the Niagara. Scott, advancing
more than two miles, suddenly found
himself in front of the whole British
army, drawn up in Lundy’s Lane. Undaunted,
he formed his line, and the
struggle began. For two hours, the
fiercest and the most desperate valor was
displayed on both sides. Every attempt
of the British to turn the flanks of the
gallant band opposed to them failed.
Their own left was turned and cut off,
but their centre stood firm. Night came
on, and the struggle was continued solely
by the flashes of the guns. The American

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>

line had suffered much, but the remnants
of the troops stood their ground
with indomitable resolution. About ten
o’clock the ammunition of the troops
began to fail. But General Brown at
length came up with strong reinforcements,
and relieved the exhausted men.
A more equal fight now ensued. Brown
determined to carry the battery on the
height at the head of the lane, that being
the key of the enemy’s position.
Riding up to Colonel Miller, he asked
him if he would storm the height.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>“I will try, sir!” was the heroic reply.
Piloted by Scott, through the darkness
to the foot of the ascent, Miller seized
the guns almost instantaneously. Meanwhile
General Ripley engaged the enemy,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>

and was supported by the gallant Scott,
who had two horses shot under him, and
was wounded in the side, but kept the
field until a wound in the shoulder
brought him to the ground. General
Brown was severely wounded, and, with
Scott, taken from the field. The command
now devolved on General Ripley.
But the battle was nearly over. The
British made one more charge, and were
repulsed in disorder, and then the firing
ceased. Ripley retired to the camp at
Chippewa. In this bloody and well
fought battle, the Americans lost eight
hundred and sixty men, killed and
wounded. The loss of the enemy was
about one thousand men. One of their
generals, Riall, was captured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> British were very anxious to obtain
the command of Lake Champlain,
and the posts in the vicinity. The Americans
had fitted out a small squadron
on the lake, and placed it under the
command of Commodore Macdonough. In
1814, a powerful British army advanced
against Plattsburgh, and a British squadron,
commanded by Captain Downie,
sailed to meet the American squadron,
then lying in Plattsburgh bay. Early on
the morning of the 11th of September,
the fleets met, and the battle commenced.</p>

<p>The Confiance, the flag-ship of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>

enemy, engaged the Saratoga, and the
contest was maintained for about two
hours, when the Confiance struck her
colors. The chief vessel of the enemy
being captured, the brig surrendered in
a few minutes; two sloops had been
captured some time before; three of the
gallies were sunk, and the others escaped.
The killed on board the American squadron
amounted to fifty-two, the wounded
to fifty-eight. Of the enemy, eighty-four
were killed, including Captain Downie,
the commander of the squadron, one
hundred and ten wounded, and eight
hundred and fifty-six remained prisoners,
a number exceeding the whole amount
of the Americans engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> success of the attack on Washington
encouraged the British general, Ross,
to undertake an expedition against another
city. Baltimore was the object of
attack. The approach to that city by
water was defended by Fort M’Henry,
garrisoned by one thousand men, under
Major Armistead; and by other temporary
works. On the 11th of September,
Admiral Cochrane appeared at the mouth
of the Patapsco, with a squadron of fifty
sail, and a strong body of British troops
was landed at North Point, about fourteen
miles below Baltimore. At sunrise,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>

on the 13th, the bombardment of the
fort commenced. The bomb vessels of
the enemy were stationed about two
miles from the fort, and were consequently
beyond the reach of its guns. Though
compelled to remain inactive, the troops
in the fort were steadfast to their posts.
The bursting of a shell within the southwest
bastion creating some confusion,
the ships of the enemy attempted to profit
by it, but they were soon compelled
to retreat to their former stations, where
they continued a tremendous bombardment
until the morning of the 14th. During
the night, some barges and rocket
vessels succeeded in passing the fort, but
they were driven back with severe loss,
by the fire from the smaller works.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the latter part of 1814, information
being received that the British intended
to make a descent on Louisiana, General
Jackson hastened to New Orleans, and
made preparations for its defence. Every
approach to the town was guarded by
batteries and gunboats. The British
fleet arrived early in December, and on
the 14th, an attack was made upon the
American gunboats on Lake Borgne.
After a desperate contest, they submitted
to a much superior force. The British
having gained a position on the banks
of the Mississippi, General Jackson, with
two thousand men, marched down, on

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>

the evening of the 23d, and attacked
them. After a hot fight, in which the
enemy lost over two hundred men, the
Americans fell back to their lines. Both
armies having received large reinforcements,
the British on the 8th of January,
moved to the assault. The Americans
drove them back in confusion. Sir Edward
Packenham was killed. Again the enemy
attempted to scale the work, and were
again driven back. At length all the
chief commanding officers being killed or
disabled, the British retreated. Their loss
in this battle was two hundred and ninety-three
killed, twelve hundred and sixty-seven
wounded, and four hundred and
eighty-four prisoners. The American loss
was only thirteen killed, and thirty-seven

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> battle of New Orleans was the last
great military event of the second war
with Great Britain. In point of fact, it
was fought after a treaty had been
signed by the commissioners of Great
Britain and the United States, assembled
for the purpose at Ghent. This battle
was of immense importance. It saved
the city of New Orleans from capture
and plunder. General Jackson’s services
on this occasion, and his difficult
and perilous campaign against the Creek
Indians, raised his reputation to a very

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>

high point; and subsequently occasioned
his elevation to the president’s chair.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the treaty of
Ghent, a squadron of the United States
navy was sent to chastise the Barbary
powers for attacking our commerce during
the war with Great Britain. The Barbary
powers concluded treaties without
a struggle, and the country, except a
few skirmishes with the Indians, remained
at peace till the war with Mexico,
of which we will now proceed to give
some sketches.</p>

<hr class="r15">

<h3 class="nobreak">BATTLE OF PALO ALTO.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the course of the year 1845, the
government of the United States ordered
General Taylor, with about three thousand

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80‒82]</span>

men, to take possession of the country
lying between the Nueces and the
Rio Grande, which country was the subject
of dispute between the governments
of Mexico and Texas. General Taylor
reached the Rio Grande, in April, 1846.
Now, the Mexican government looked
upon this movement as a trespass upon
their territory, and therefore declared
war. Leaving a small force to occupy
Fort Polk, opposite Matamoras, General
Taylor, with the main body of his army,
marched to Point Isabel, at the mouth
of the Rio Grande. Soon after, he heard
that the Mexicans had commenced to
bombard Fort Polk, and that General
Arista, with a large body of troops, had
crossed the river.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span>

There was great difference
in the strength of the two armies,
but General Taylor was a very determined
man, and he said he would go
and relieve Fort Polk, and fight whoever
opposed him. He started on the morning
of the 7th of May, and about two
o’clock the next day, encountered the
Mexicans at Palo Alto. A dreadful battle
was then fought. The Mexicans were
much more numerous than the Americans,
but the Americans were braver
soldiers, and they had some fine guns,
which could be quickly moved to any
part of the field. While conducting the
movement of these guns, Major Ringgold,
a very brave and skilful officer, was
shot through both thighs and fell to the
ground. To add to his sufferings, his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span>

horse fell on him. He was taken off the
field, and died, after enduring great pains
for two or three days. The battle was
chiefly fought with the artillery. But
at one time, about one thousand Mexican
lancers moved forward to attack the
Americans. This splendid looking body
of cavalry, however, was driven back by
the dreadful fire from the American guns,
and the whole Mexican army retreated.
General Taylor and his brave soldiers
slept upon the field of battle.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day after the battle of Palo
Alto, General Taylor moved forward towards
Fort Polk. He could hear the
sound of the bombardment, and he was
anxious to relieve the small garrison he
had left in the fort. He soon came up
with the Mexicans again. They had received
more troops and had taken a
strong position. It was a place called
Resaca de la Palma, or the Palm Ravine.
General Taylor did not hesitate to attack
them. He and his men were confident
that they could beat many times their
number of Mexicans. The victory at

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>

Palo Alto had assured them of a victory
wherever they should meet a foe. The
flying artillery was brought into service
and poured quick and murderous discharges
into the Mexican ranks. Then
Captain May, with his dragoons charged
down the ravine, through the bushes,
and over the guns of the enemy, cutting
down all who came within reach of their
sabres. General La Vega fell into their
hands. The Mexicans continued the
fight even after they had lost their cannon,
but the Americans soon cleared the
field at the point of the bayonet, and then
pushed on to Fort Polk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> General Taylor had taken possession
of Matamoras, he waited for reinforcements
and then moved forward to
attack Monterey. This city was very

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>

strongly fortified by nature and art. The
Saddle mountains extended on three
sides of it, while the other side was protected
by a high wall and strong works.
Besides every house was so constructed
of stone as to be looked upon as a fortification.
General Ampudia, with about
eleven thousand men formed its garrison.
General Taylor’s army only numbered
six thousand men, yet he advanced, and
commenced the siege on the 21st of September.
The Americans displayed the
greatest bravery in the various attacks,
and at the close of the first day of the
siege, had taken the Bishop’s Palace and
other strong outworks. The next day
was employed by the Americans in preparing
for another grand attack.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 93‒95]</span>
On the 23d they assaulted the city on two
sides, and their batteries made terrible
havoc among the Mexicans. The Texan
rangers cut their way through the houses
with pickaxes, and the fighting in the
streets became dreadful and destructive.
The Mexicans were collected in the heart
of the city, and to that point the Americans
advanced. Night put an end to
the fighting, and the next morning, the
Mexican general proposed to surrender
the city. Officers from both sides met
and agreed to certain terms. Then the
Mexican army marched out of the city,
and the Americans entered and took
possession of it. So it seemed that nothing
could stop the progress of General
Taylor and his men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Mexicans, though beaten so often,
did not lose their spirits. Their great
general, Santa Anna, soon collected an
army of more than twenty thousand men,
and advanced towards Monterey. Now
General Taylor’s army was much reduced
in numbers, and the most of his troops
were volunteers, who had never been in
battle. But he resolved to await the
attack of the great Mexican army at a
place called Buena Vista. On the 22d
of February, Santa Anna appeared and
attacked the Americans; but was repulsed.
The great battle was fought on

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span>

the next day. It commenced early in
the morning, and continued until night
put an end to the work of death. The
Mexicans almost overwhelmed the little
army under General Taylor; but each
man fought like a hero, and every attack
of the enemy was repulsed. Captain
Bragg gave them plenty of grape-shot.
Three times during the day, was the
American army saved by the skill and
effect with which the artillery was managed.
At length night came, and the
exhausted troops sank down on the field.
The next morning, the Mexican army
had retreated and could not be found.
General Taylor had therefore gained a
victory over an army more than four
times as large as his own.</p>

Santa Fe and Chihuahua was very
little known, and therefore when Colonel
Doniphan set out he did not expect to
encounter the toils and dangers he afterwards
met. A vast and dreary desert
was to be traversed, and a hostile people
to be dealt with. Colonel Doniphan began
his march on the 17th of December,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>

1846, and soon after reached the tract
of country called by the Mexicans the
“desert of death,” where the bones of
murdered men and famished animals
were strewn along the road, and where
not a drop of water nor a blade of grass
met the eyes of the traveller. After
passing through this desert, the troops
reached Bracito, where they repulsed an
attack made by the Mexicans. Doniphan
was reinforced soon after, and
marched for Chihuahua. Near that
place he again defeated the enemy. He
remained six weeks at Chihuahua, and
seeing nothing of General Wool, marched

But ladders being planted, the troops
cut small holes with their axes and
threw fire into the church. A breach

party plunged through it to attack
the enemy, who then fled. The Americans
pursued and killed all they overtook.
About one hundred and fifty
Mexicans were killed. The next day,
the survivors sued for mercy, and the
insurrection was at an end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the breaking out of the war with
Mexico, orders were sent to Commodore
Sloat, who commanded the squadron of
United States vessels in the Pacific, to
take possession of all the ports of Upper
California. This was done, the people
making but little resistance. Colonel
Fremont, the famous explorer of the
far-west, then hoisted the flag of the
United States at Sonoma, a town in the
northern part of California. The Mexican
governor fled. Colonel Fremont with
one hundred and fifty men, then hurried

Stockton, who had taken command of
the squadron. On the 13th of August,
1846, the united forces entered the capital
of California—Pueblo de los Angelos.
Thus the conquest of this valuable country
was complete. The people seemed
to be very well satisfied with their conquerors.
Commodore Stockton issued a
proclamation, announcing that he took
possession of the territory by authority
of the government of the United States,
and offering security and protection to
all who submit to that authority.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">SIEGE OF VERA CRUZ.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the capture of Monterey, as the
Mexicans did not seem disposed for
peace, the government of the United
States determined to prosecute a more
decisive campaign. A large army was

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span>

collected at Anton Lizardo, and Major-General
Winfield Scott took command of
it. A land and naval attack upon the
city of Vera Cruz and the Castle of San
Juan Ulloa was fixed upon as the first
object. The fleet, under Commodore
Conner, transported the army to a landing
place selected by General Scott, and
the landing was effected on the 9th of
March, 1847. Four thousand five hundred
men were thrown upon the shore
at once, the Mexicans making no resistance.
Very soon the rest of the army
was landed, and then they formed a
great line around the city. Then the
great guns were brought ashore and a
brisk fire opened by the besiegers. The
Mexicans returned the fire from the city

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span>

and castle. While the soldiers were doing
this, a few small steam vessels sailed
up near to the castle and commenced
firing upon it. This was a bold exploit,
and if the Mexicans had been equal to
the Americans in gunnery, they would
have made the vessels pay for the boldness
of their commanders. A tremendous
fire of cannon balls and bomb-shells
was kept up by the naval and land forces
until the morning of the 26th of March,
when the inhabitants, who had suffered
much, compelled the governor to surrender
the city and castle to General
Scott. Commissioners were appointed
by the commanders of both armies, as is
usual in such cases, and terms of capitulation agreed upon. The
Mexican troops were to march out of the city, lay down their arms,
and then march for the interior, being prisoners of war on parole, and
the city and castle, with all their artillery and ammunition and public
stores were to be given up to the United States troops.</p>

<p>After the capitulation, General Worth
was appointed military governor of the
city, and the troops had a short rest
from the constant exertions of the siege.
During this siege, General Scott lost very
few men; but the enemy suffered a great
deal. So that this fine city and strong
castle did not cost the captors much,
while it gave them an entrance to the
great road leading to the city of Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 8th of April, the van of General
Scott’s army began its march from Vera
Cruz, for the interior of Mexico. The
troops met with no opposition until they
approached a rocky pass called Cerro

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>

Gordo. This place, which was very strong
by nature, had been carefully fortified by
the Mexicans, under General Santa Anna.
They thought that General Scott’s men
were not brave enough to venture to attack
such a strong position, defended by
about fifteen thousand well furnished
and disciplined troops. But General
Scott soon formed his plan of attack, and
on the 17th of April, ordered his divisions
to take their appointed positions.
The next morning, the troops advanced
to the attack, under an awful fire from
the Mexican batteries. Colonel Harney,
with a brigade of troops, rushed up the
height of Cerro Gordo, on which the principal
battery was erected, and after a
short struggle, drove the enemy from

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>

their works. By two o’clock in the afternoon
the victory was complete. Five
generals, many other officers, three thousand
soldiers, forty-three pieces of cannon,
and a great quantity of small arms
were taken. Santa Anna, with the remnant
of his army, fled towards the city
of Mexico, pursued by General Worth.
Great numbers of the Mexicans fell in
the conflict and pursuit. General Scott
lost about two hundred and fifty men.
Among the prisoners was the brave General
La Vega, who had been captured
before at Resaca de la Palma. If all
the Mexican generals had been equal to
La Vega, General Scott would have had
much harder fighting at Cerro Gordo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> defeat of the Mexicans at Cerro
Gordo opened the road for the United
States troops as far as the city of Puebla,
at which place General Scott was compelled
to halt to refresh his men, and
wait for reinforcements. On the 7th of
August, he began his march for the capital.
General Santa Anna had fortified
nearly every available place to check
General Scott’s progress, and it was necessary
that some of the strong positions
should be taken before he could proceed.
One of these was Contreras, defended by
General Valencia, with a great body of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>

troops and twenty-two cannon. A detachment
from General Scott’s army attacked
this place on the 19th of August,
but could not withstand the tremendous
fire of the enemy. The next morning,
the detachment, which was commanded
by General Smith, having gained a road
in the rear of the works, advanced to the
assault. Colonel Riley headed the storming
party, rushed up to the works under
a heavy fire, and after a short struggle
captured the cannon and drove the enemy
before him. General Shields cut off the
retreat, and whole companies were forced
to surrender. Thus another complete
triumph was gained by the Americans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the capture of Contreras, the Mexicans
were forced to concentrate at Churubusco,
which was still more strongly
fortified than Contreras. General Scott
brought his whole army to the attack
upon Churubusco, and never did men
behave with more valor and heroism.
The fire of the Mexicans was tremendous,
and the Americans suffered much from
it. But post after post was carried, and
the enemy found that their superior
numbers could not withstand the onset.
General Worth stormed the bridge, which
was the strongest part of the works,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span>

while General Twiggs brought his artillery
to bear on a convent, which, however,
held out until General Twiggs was
reinforced, when it surrendered. In the
meantime, General Shields, with two
brigades, encountered about four thousand
Mexican infantry, whose flanks
were protected by three thousand cavalry,
and after a severe struggle defeated
them. The enemy were routed in every
part of the field, and pursued nearly to
the gates of Mexico. This was the most
glorious day’s work the American army
had yet performed.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CAPTURE OF MOLINO DEL REY.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Anna</span> saved the capital from
immediate assault after the battle of Churubusco,
by procuring an armistice for
peace negotiations. His real object was

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span>

to gain time to prepare munitions of war
and strengthen the defences of the city.
General Scott discovered this, and put
an end to the armistice. He then resolved
to attempt the capture of Molino
del Rey, a strongly fortified and garrisoned
foundry. General Worth, with
three thousand one hundred and fifty
men, was detached for this service. General
Worth was ignorant of the great
strength of the works, but he made skilful
disposition and was determined to
succeed. There were three assaulting
columns. The first was to assail Molino
del Rey, covered by the fire of some
heavy artillery. The centre was to consist
of five hundred picked men, commanded
by Major Wright. The third

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span>

column was commanded by Colonel
M’Intosh, and consisted of the second
brigade, supported by Duncan’s artillery.
A strong body of troops were held in reserve.
On the morning of the 8th of
September, the columns advanced to the
assault, a tremendous fire from the batteries
having shaken the walls of the
enemy’s works. The central position
was carried after a bloody struggle, in
which Major Wright and one half his
force were either killed or wounded. The
Mexicans had masked batteries, which
the Americans could not see till they
were within range of them. On the right
of the field, the assailants were completely
successful, carrying the works,
and slaughtering the enemy without

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span>

mercy. On the left Duncan kept up a
heavy fire upon the stone foundry, called
Casa Mata. The assault was here repulsed;
but Duncan’s artillery restored
the fortune of the contest, and compelled
the Mexicans to evacuate the foundry,
even while they were playing triumphant
music for victory. Thus General Worth
was victorious in every part of the field,
and the enemy were in flight. But the
victory was purchased by the loss of one
half of the division. The loss of the
Mexicans in killed, wounded and prisoners
was immense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the capture of Molino del Rey, and
the adjacent works, the castle of Chapultepec
was exposed to attack upon two
sides, and General Scott hastened to
form his plan for the storming of it and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span>

the gates of the capital. On the 12th
of September, the batteries opened upon
the castle, and with such effect that
Santa Anna was prevented from throwing
reinforcements into it. The Mexicans
returned the fire, but as they were
not equal to the Americans in gunnery,
they did very little damage. On the 13th,
the assault was made. General Quitman,
with one division, advanced upon the
northeast side, while General Pillow,
with another division, assailed the height
on the west. The castle was garrisoned
by picked troops, well supplied with artillery,
and commanded by the veteran,
General Bravo. A determined defence
was therefore expected, and the Americans
nerved themselves for it. Pillow’s

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>

troops dashed up the rocky height amid
a heavy and destructive fire from the
enemy, and so rapid was the assault
that the Mexicans were driven from post
to post, until they had no chance to fire
their mines. General Pillow fell, severely
wounded, and General Cadwalader assumed
the command of his division.
Ladders were prepared, the walls of the
castle mounted, and the American flag
planted upon them. In the meantime,
General Quitman advanced upon the opposite
side, defeated a large detachment
of the enemy, and forced his way up the
height, with a rapidity and valor equal
to that of the other division. A portion
of his troops arrived in time to storm the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>

walls, and enter side by side with Pillow’s
troops. The Mexicans fought
bravely, even after the Americans had
entered the fort. Few of them asked for
quarter, and fewer obtained it; as the
victors were exasperated at the cruelties
of the Mexicans at Molino del Rey. A
great many prisoners were taken, and
among others, General Bravo. Thus this
fine castle, which the Mexicans had looked
upon as impregnable, fell into the hands
of the troops, whose progress no obstacle
could check.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Americans now advanced to attack
the strong defences of the capital.
By General Scott’s plan, General Twiggs
kept up a heavy fire upon the southern
part of the city, to divert the attention
of the enemy, while General Worth advanced
to attack the San Cosmo gate,
and General Quitman the Belen gate.
The troops of these divisions were exposed
to a tremendous and destructive
fire from batteries placed along the roads
and at the gates. But the men now
seemed insensible to danger, and pressed
on with a valor that never was surpassed.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>

Many valuable officers fell at their head,
and this excited a spirit of revenge
among the troops, which led them to
give but little quarter to the enemy. By
night-fall, both gates were carried, and
the conquerors had gained a foothold in
the city. The next morning, while General
Scott was preparing to complete
the work, the government surrendered.
The Mexican army had fled from the
city. On the 14th of September, the
Americans entered Mexico in triumph.</p>

Cadwalader, who, hearing of his danger,
hurried up, with eight hundred men to

united forces, seized some heights which

was here attacked by a strong force, but
made good his defence, charging the
Mexicans incessantly, until their strength

Cadwalader about fifty. This victory

of an hour, the batteries of the enemy
were silenced; and a portion of General

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have already given a slight outline

the exploits of his little army.</p>

<p>The battle of Bracito was the first
engagement fought by the mounted
troops, under the command of Colonel
Doniphan. It occurred on Christmas
day, 1847. Colonel Doniphan’s men
had marched to within a short distance
of the town of El Paso, and had encamped
near a bend in the Bracito river. The
Mexicans, in great force, came upon
them, while they were in search of wood

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>

and water. A quick rally was made,
and the Americans drew up on foot to
receive the charge of the enemy’s cavalry.
The Mexicans displayed a black flag,
with skull and cross-bones worked upon
it, and said they would give no quarter
nor ask it. A heavy shower of balls
from the rifles of the Americans caused
the cavalry to wheel and retreat in confusion.
A small party of the Americans
then rushed up to the enemy’s line, and
captured their cannon, dragging it into
the American line. This daring and
desperate act completely astonished the
Mexicans, and they soon after made a
hurried retreat, having lost about two
hundred men. Colonel Doniphan lost
very few men.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel Doniphan’s</span> force was increased
to a thousand men, with four pieces of
artillery, soon after his arrival at El Paso.
Continuing his march towards Chihuahua,
he reached the valley of the Sacramento.
The Mexicans had taken a
strong position on the banks of the Sacramento,
and it was well fortified. Colonel
Doniphan saw that the only chance
of fighting them at all upon even ground
was to get possession of the high tableland
between the Seco and Sacramento
rivers. Accordingly a small force was
directed to advance for that purpose.
This gallant band stormed the intrenchments

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span>

and gained the tableland, where
the whole American army was drawn up
for battle. The Mexicans opened a
heavy fire, and it was returned with
more effect by Captain Weightman’s artillery.
Then the troops were ordered
to storm the works. A gallant charge
was made, amid a tremendous fire, and,
after a three hour’s fight, the enemy
were completely defeated. The Mexicans
lost about three hundred men, ten
pieces of artillery, and a large quantity
of ammunition. This battle was justly
considered one of the most brilliant that
was fought during the war. It raised
the fame of Colonel Doniphan and his
brave band of warriors to a very high
point in public esteem.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after the Americans took possession
of New Mexico, General Kearney,
with only one hundred dragoons for an
escort, began a march through an unknown
and hostile country for Upper
California. On the 5th of December,
having reached the frontier settlements
of that territory, he was met by Captain
Gillespie, with a party of riflemen, who
had been sent out to give him information
of an insurrection that had occurred
in California. Captain Gillespie informed
General Kearney that an armed party
of Californians was encamped at San

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>

Pasqual, and the general immediately
resolved to attack them. At daybreak,
on the 6th of December, he encountered
the enemy, and a well-fought action
ensued. The California lancers committed
some havoc among the Americans,
but a furious charge from the dragoons
compelled them to retreat. The fight,
however, was renewed, when the enemy
saw the small force that pursued them,
and they were not completely defeated
until about one-third of the Americans
were killed or wounded. The loss of the
Californians was also heavy. The subsequent
junction of Commodore Stockton
and his brave band of sailors with the
force of General Kearney, decided the
conquest of California.</p>

CALIFORNIA.</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> June, 1846, Commodore Sloat having
received information that the Mexicans
had crossed the Rio Grande, determined
to take possession of the principal
ports of Upper California. He sailed to
Monterey in the frigate Savannah, and
was there joined by the Cyanne and Levant,
vessels of war. Having examined
the defences of the small town, and completed
the arrangements for capturing
it, the commodore sent Captain Mervine
to demand its surrender. The Mexican
commandant replied that he was not
authorized to surrender the town, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>

referred Commodore Sloat to Governor
Castro. Captain Mervine then landed
two hundred and fifty seamen and marines,
hoisted the star-spangled banner
amid cheers from the troops and bystanders,
and a national salute from the
squadron. Commodore Sloat then issued
a proclamation, announcing that war
existed between the United States and
Mexico, and the arms of the United
States would be carried throughout
California. The conquest was subsequently
completed as just related, by the great
exertions of Commodore Stockton, who
succeeded Sloat, and landed men from
his fleet, marched to the relief of Kearney,
fought pitched battles with the enemy,
and never left the affair until the conquest
of the country was fully effected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Kearney</span> with his small, and
almost worn-out force, reached San Diego
just in time to join Commodore Stockton
in carrying out a plan for reducing the
Californians to submission. On the 29th
of December, the little army, consisting
of about six hundred men—the greater
part of them being seamen, started from
San Diego, to march toward Puebla de
los Angelos, the capital and chief city
of California. They had proceeded about
one hundred and ten miles toward the
Rio San Gabriel, when they found about
six hundred mounted men, with four

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span>

pieces of artillery, drawn up to dispute
the passage of the river. On the 8th of
January, 1847, the necessary arrangements
having been made, the Americans
waded across the river, reserved their
fire until they reached the opposite bank,
repelled a charge of the enemy, and then
charged them in gallant style. After an
action of an hour and a half, the enemy
were driven from the field, on which the
conquerors encamped for the night. The
loss of the Californians was severe.</p>

<p>This battle, fought by the seamen and
marines of Commodore Stockton, is justly
regarded as one of the most extraordinary
exploits of the whole Mexican war, which,
as we have seen, abounded in all sorts of
romantic and heroic achievements.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">General James Shields</span> distinguished
himself in several battles during the
Mexican war, and was severely wounded
upon two occasions. In the great battle
of Cerro Gordo, General Shields, with
his brigade of volunteers, was directed
to storm the height west of the principal
battery of the Mexicans, which commanded
the Jalapa road. The order was
promptly and bravely executed. The
volunteers advanced up the height with
all the steadiness and courage of veterans,
and carrying the height drove the
enemy along the Jalapa road. As General
Shields was advancing with his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span>

men, he was shot through the lungs.
This paralyzed him, and he was carried
off the field. The wound was at first
thought to be mortal, but it happily
proved to be otherwise. The general
recovered and joined the army in time
to share in the glory of the battles of
Contreras, Churubusco, and the Garitas
of Mexico.</p>

<p>General Shields is something more than
a mere warrior. After the conclusion of
the war, we find him assisting in the deliberation
of the highest legislative body
in the country, the senate of the United
States. He is not a native of our country,
but like the brave General Montgomery,
who fell at the storming of Quebec, he is
one of our adopted citizens. He was
born in Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the flag of the United States
had been planted upon the National
Palace of the capital, by General Quitman,
General Scott, with the main army,
entered the city. The officers were
dressed in full uniform, the military
bands poured forth the “Star-Spangled
Banner,” and “Hail Columbia,” and
every thing was arranged in such a
manner as to gratify the toil-worn, but
triumphant troops.</p>

<p>The Mexicans were now disposed to
listen to the overtures of peace made by

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span>

the commissioner, Mr. N. P. Trist. They
appointed commissioners, who met Mr.
Trist, at Guadalupe Hidalgo. After considerable
discussion, a treaty of peace
was agreed upon, by which New Mexico,
Upper California, and the territory between
the Nueces and Rio Grande were
ceded to the United States. This treaty
was ratified by the two governments,
and in the spring of 1848, the American
army evacuated Mexico.</p>

<p>The Mexican war thus brought to a
close forms one of the most brilliant
epochs in the military history of our
country. It was signalized by astonishing
displays of bravery and military skill;
and added to our union, several states,
among which is California, the richest
gold region in the world.
